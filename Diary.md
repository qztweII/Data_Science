## Actvity 1
This had a lot of theory about data and how they are collected, and what they are used for. 

## Activity 2
Today I will use Pandas for data science. Here I will be making a data frame. 

I had trouble importing that csv because I am trying to import that file from the parent directory so I don't have to have a 40MB thing in every folder. (I have then read the assignments thing and realised that I don't actually need a folder for each lesson I do)

*I realised I did not actually finish Activity 1's practical part, so I did it today.*
