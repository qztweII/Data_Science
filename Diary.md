## Actvity 1
This had a lot of theory about data and how they are collected, and what they are used for. 

## Activity 2
Today I will use Pandas for data science. Here I will be making a data frame. 

I had trouble importing that csv because I am trying to import that file from the parent directory so I don't have to have a 40MB thing in every folder. (I have then read the assignments thing and realised that I don't actually need a folder for each lesson I do)

*I realised I did not actually finish Activity 1's practical part, so I did it today.*

## Activity 2 cont. 
Today was quite a surprise. I learnt that pandas's describe feature is so convinient, showing everything from the total, the mean, standard deviation and even median, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, as well as maximum and minimum. 

Here, I learnt that ten-year-olds have been in the olympics, as well as ninetyseven-year-olds. They are both quite the achievement. 

I have also done some extras, like filtering based on a characteristic (in this case, it is finding out who won gold in all of the events)
